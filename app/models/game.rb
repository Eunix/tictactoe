# The Game class of Tic-Tac-Toe. For simplicity and readability I use matrix with
# geometrical series of power of two:
#
# 1   2   4
# 8   16  32
# 64  128 256
#
# If player reaches one of the winning sums the game is over and this player is 
# the winner. Winning sums are very easy to calculate â€” sum of every three of marks
# in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. For example:  1 + 2 + 4 = 7. A player 
# is the winner if it reaches 7 in total sums of moves
#
# The game starts with player_x's move
